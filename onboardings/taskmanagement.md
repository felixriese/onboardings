# Onboarding to Task Management

Getting things done (GTD) is the "art of stressfree productivity" by David Allen.
We strongly recommend to [read his book](https://www.amazon.de/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563)
from 2015.

## Implementation

One implementation of the book on macOS can look like that:

* Task management: [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) for Mac and iOS

* Reference material: [Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com) and [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) for Mac and iOS, standard case binders
