# Onboarding on Security

This onboarding should be a starting point for the reader to upgrade the
security of her/his devices such as phones and laptops. We cannot guarantee its
completeness or correctness.

## Laptop security

- **Backup strategy:** *3-2-1 rule*
  - 3 copies of your data, meaning at least two different backups
  - 2 different types of backups (external hard drives, usb drive, sd card, DVDs, network attached storage)
  - 1 offsite backup (online, network, external hard drive at a friends place)
- **File encrytion:** Encrypt your computer (e.g. FileVault), encrypt your backups (e.g. TimeMachine)
- **E-mail encryption:** Use e.g. [this](https://www.macobserver.com/tips/quick-tip/macos-using-email-encryption-apples-mail/) tutorial for macOS. In short: get a free e-mail certificate, add it to your keychain on your Mac, relaunch the mail application and then you are able to sign (and later encrypt) your e-mails.
- **Updates:** Always keep your operating system and all your software up-to-date. Also, only use operating systems and software that is getting updates on a regular basis (unlike e.g. Windows XP).
- **Passwords:** Use strong passwords and a secure password manager (e.g. 1Password).
- **Firewall:** Activate it.
- **Connect to public WIFIs** only via VPN.


## Mobile phone security

- **Passcode:** Use 6-digit passcode instead of the 4-digit code.
